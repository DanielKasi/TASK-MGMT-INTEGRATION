# Module Refactoring Migration Guide

This guide shows how to migrate your existing Task Management app to the modular architecture.

## ✅ What's Already Done

1. **Platform API Structure** - Created `src/platform/v1/` with all necessary exports
2. **Module Descriptor** - Defined integration contracts in `src/platform-integration/`
3. **Module Manifest** - Created `module.json` with module metadata
4. **Navigation Utilities** - Added dual-life routing support
5. **Sync Script** - Created automation for host integration

## 🔄 Next Steps (Optional Refactoring)

### Step 1: Update Imports Gradually

You can gradually update imports to use the platform API. This is **optional** - your current imports will continue to work.

**Example refactoring:**

```typescript
// ❌ Old way (still works)
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { selectUser } from "@/store/auth/selectors";
import apiRequest from "@/lib/apiRequest";

// ✅ New way (recommended for modules)
import { Button } from "@/platform/v1/components";
import { selectUser } from "@/platform/v1/auth";
import { apiRequest } from "@/platform/v1/api";
```

### Step 2: Use Navigation Utilities

For components that need to work in both standalone and embedded contexts:

```typescript
import { buildModulePath } from "@/platform-integration/navigation";

// This works in both contexts
const dashboardPath = buildModulePath('/dashboard');
// Standalone: '/dashboard'
// Embedded: '/tasks/dashboard'
```

### Step 3: Test Standalone Mode

Your app already works in standalone mode! Test it:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` - everything should work as before.

### Step 4: Test Module Integration (Future)

When you're ready to integrate this as a module:

```bash
# In the host platform
node scripts/sync-module.mjs \
  --repo "file:///path/to/this/module" \
  --tag "v1.0.0" \
  --name "tasks"
```

## 🎯 Current Status

✅ **Module Ready**: Your app is now a proper module that can be integrated into a host platform  
✅ **Standalone Compatible**: Runs independently as a full Next.js app  
✅ **Platform API**: All utilities available through `@/platform/v1/*`  
✅ **Dual-Life Routing**: Navigation works in both contexts  
✅ **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support maintained  

## 🚀 Ready for Integration

Your module is now ready to be:

1. **Tagged and released** as a Git repository
2. **Synced into a host platform** using the sync script
3. **Used alongside other modules** in a modular architecture

## 📁 Module Structure Summary

```
src/
├── app/                          # ✅ Your existing routes (ready for sync)
├── platform/v1/                 # ✅ Platform API surface
├── platform-integration/         # ✅ Integration contracts
├── store/                        # ✅ Redux store (ready for sync)
├── components/                   # ✅ UI components (ready for sync)
└── lib/                          # ✅ Utilities (ready for sync)

module.json                       # ✅ Module manifest
scripts/sync-module.mjs          # ✅ Sync automation
```

## 🔧 Configuration

- **Mount Path**: `/tasks` (configurable in `module.json`)
- **Platform Version**: `>=1.0.0 <2.0.0`
- **Routes**: All your existing routes are included

## 📝 Notes

- **No Breaking Changes**: Your existing code continues to work
- **Gradual Migration**: Update imports at your own pace
- **Backward Compatible**: Old imports still work alongside new ones
- **Future Proof**: Ready for host platform integration

Your Task Management module is now properly structured for the modular architecture! 🎉
